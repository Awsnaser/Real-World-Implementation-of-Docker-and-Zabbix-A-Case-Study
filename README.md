# Real-World-Implementation-of-Docker-and-Zabbix-A-Case-Study
 
 ## Overview
This exam is designed to test the student's understanding and hands-on experience with Docker and Zabbix. The exam is divided into four sections, each with a specific focus and objective. 

## Section 1: Docker
The first section aims to test the student's understanding of Docker containers by having them implement a docker-compose stack on a virtual machine. This section will assess the student's knowledge of docker networking, volume mounts, environment variables, and basic container configuration. 

## Section 2: Zabbix
The second section is designed to provide students with a real-world scenario of how the Zabbix monitoring tool can be implemented and used. Students will use their knowledge of Zabbix to configure a docker-compose stack and install Zabbix-agent and Zabbix-proxy on separate virtual machines, giving them hands-on experience with different approaches. This section will also test the student's understanding of network communication between different VMs.

## Section 3: Web Server
The third section focuses on web server usage, requiring the student to show their skills in installing, configuring, and starting a web server that will listen on localhost and redirect requests to the Zabbix-server frontend.

## Section 4: Zabbix Frontend
The fourth and final section of the exam will test the student's familiarity with the Zabbix frontend, including basic host adding, PSK encryption usage, and template creation with new items and triggers. 

## Grading
Each section is worth 10 points and the exam is graded out of 40 points total.
